/*
n Ciel's restaurant, a waiter is training. Since the waiter isn't good at arithmetic, sometimes he gives
guests wrong change. Ciel gives him a simple problem. What is A-B (A minus B) ?
Surprisingly, his answer is wrong. To be more precise, his answer has exactly one wrong digit.
Can you imagine this? Can you make the same mistake in this problem?
